		<p>Some projects I have been a part of are - </p>
		<ul>Javascript Username Randomiser - I was asked to make a username generator for a company that would take the fullname and date of birth of user and depending on some info would depend on how the string would manipulated - for example if they were born on a leap year the date and month and the front of the username, and it  inclued other string manipulations such as re-writing the string backwards. </ul>
		<ul>Arduino GPS - Another project I was a part of was the making of an arduino GPS, where you would take the GPS and it would bring back information such as altitude, coordinates, how many satelittes you're connected to, speed(in knots) etc. So you can do many things with this such as finding you're location and dispalying it on a screen or as speedometre.</ul>
		<ul>Young Enterprise - This was when we had to make a product and then sell it to the public, so me and my team crafted tie die style bags and then we went to a convention and sell them at our stand that we also designed. The goal was to make a prodfit which me and my team were able to do. My role was in this project was project manager and head of design.</ul>
		<ul>Java Game - This project's aim was to create game with the use of Java. The game was a maze game that, but trying to get from A to B there was enemies 	trying to stop you and to beat them you had to defeat them with you're own weapons. The character you played was a robot and the enemies were also robots. The game also had an autocomplete feature so the game would automatically finish for you by running the correct route.</ul>
