		<br>WORK EXPERIENCE 
 
		<br>Transgression Park  - October 2014 
		<br>In October 2014 I carried out a weeks work experience at a local indoor skateboarding facility. My duties included general tidying of equipment, sorting files and equipment maintenance. This was an enjoyable experience as I was able to gain insight into the world of working whilst doing something that I enjoy.  
		<br> 
		<br>Sky Customer Service – July 2015 
		<br>July 2015 is when I attended the Sky Work experience program, Learning and tutored on customer service. I was there for 5 days and executed tasks such as listen to live calls and past calls that were received – About problems that the customer had and how the employee dealt with it. I enjoyed this experience very much as I learned a lot of information and I was working in a very enjoyable environment. I also worked well with the five other people who were also doing the program. 
		<br> 
		<br>Hibernian F.C Catering team – Early 2016
		<br>Early 2016 I worked at Easter Road as part of Hibernian F.C's catering staff, this involved me working at a Kiosk and selling customers goods such as; Pie's, Hot Drinks, Sweets and Soft Drinks. This really helped my Customer Service skills as it made used to dealing with customers on a daily basis. This job was kind of optional because they would send you a message asking you if you could work. So I worked most times they asked me unless I was really unable to work. 
		<br> 
		<br>PERSONAL INTERESTS  
		<br>In my spare time I like talk and meet up with my friends whenever I can, I'm also a big fanatic of Football, so when a game ever comes on TV – doesn’t matter the team – I watch it. I also play football whenever I'm free, plus other sports such as Basketball and occasionally Baseball.
